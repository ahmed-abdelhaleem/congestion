It was mentioned days before a public holiday are tax-free,
I assumed it's only 1 day before even if it's saturday, is that right?

Regarding the 60 minutes rule, I sorted by dates in ascending order, and starting from one specific  
date I compare it to all the following dates within 60 minutes, is that right ?
